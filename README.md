## Project Structure üìÅ

This Flutter project utilizes a clean architecture approach to enhance maintainability and scalability. The project structure is organized as follows:

- `lib/core/`: Contains core utilities and functionalities used throughout the application.
- `lib/features/`: Organized by feature modules, each containing its own presentation, domain, and data layers.
- `lib/main.dart`: The entry point of the application.

This structure promotes a clear separation of concerns and facilitates easier management and extension of the codebase.
